What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

How does deep learning work?
Deep learning is a subset of AI that uses neural networks to process data and learn representations.

Explain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
RAG enhances language models by retrieving relevant external data before generating responses.

What is the difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4?
GPT-4 is an improved version of GPT-3, offering better reasoning, factual accuracy, and more nuanced responses.

How do transformers work in NLP?
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process words in context, making them highly effective for language tasks.

What is fine-tuning in AI models?
Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve performance on a particular task.

What is FAISS used for?
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that helps search large-scale vector databases efficiently.

How does tokenization work in NLP?
Tokenization splits text into smaller units (tokens) for easier processing by machine learning models.

What is the role of embeddings in AI?
Embeddings convert words or sentences into numerical representations, making it easier for AI models to process language.

What is LangChain, and how does it help in AI applications?
LangChain is a framework that simplifies building AI applications that use **retrieval-based** processing and external knowledge sources.
